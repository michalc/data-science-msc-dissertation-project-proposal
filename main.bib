	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has made a significant impact on various supply chains (SCs). All around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic affects different dimensions of SCs, including but not limited to finance, lead time, demand changes, and production performance. There is an urgent need to respond to this grand challenge. The catastrophic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted scholars to develop innovative SC disruption management strategies and disseminate them via numerous scientific articles. However, there is still a lack of systematic literature survey studies that aim to identify promising SC disruption management strategies through the bibliometric, network, and thematic analyses. In order to address this drawback, this study presents a set of upto-date bibliometric, network, and thematic analyses to identify the influential contributors, main research streams, and disruption management strategies related to the SC performance under the COVID-19 settings. The conducted analyses reveal that resilience and sustainability are the pri­ mary SC topics. Furthermore, the major research themes are found to be food, health-related SCs, and technology-aided tools (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), and block­ chains). Various disruption management strategies focusing on resilience and sustainability themes are extracted from the most influential studies that were identified as a part of this work. In addition, we draw some managerial insights to ensure a resilient and sustainable supply of critical products in the event of a pandemic, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and vaccines.},

	abstract = {As with any industry, higher education institutions must remain current in order to attract quality students to their programs. At the undergraduate and masters level, online courses and degrees are becoming increasingly popular, especially for those individuals who are geographically separated from their institution or interest or who work a full-time job and are unable to attend locally. While we have seen growth of these types of programs, doctoral programs have remained relatively traditional. Most doctoral programs are designed for students who have just recently finished a master’s degree and are able to enroll full-time in a residential program. We feel that this focus on recruiting this type of student does prevent individuals with years of professional industry experience from not only earning a doctoral degree, but bringing their talents to the institution. Our research sets out to compare traditional doctoral programs and their respective dissertation processes with the Agile professional studies doctoral program. The research compares and contrasts traditional and Agile dissertation methods as well as discuses core differences between the two program types. It also summarizes enrollment and completion rates from various private, public, and online institutions and ends with a summary and ideas for future work.},

	abstract = {Today, Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games entertain tens of millions of players world-wide. This growing population expects new game designs and more scalable games every year. However, few tools and environments exist for game designers and implementers; of these, even fewer are available to researchers and game communities. In this work, we introduce RTSenv, an environment and associated set of tools for RTS games. Our environment can conﬁgure and manage the main aspects of RTS games, such as maps, computer-controlled units, and game scenarios. RTSenv leverages multi-cluster systems and reactive fault tolerance mechanisms to perform robust, multi-machine, and multi-instance game experiments. Using our reference implementation of RTSenv in DAS-4, a real multi-cluster system, and Amazon EC2, a commercial cloud, we show that our approach can be used in a variety of scenarios. Our results give evidence that several common assumptions made by researchers about game workloads do not hold in general for RTS games and thus warrant a more detailed investigation.},
